So, you are gonna find here both Spyder and RStudio (IDEs) projects, which means the repo is a blend of Python and R resources, and their scripts to do the above-mentioned steps.</p> <p>The repository, its Spyder and RStudio projects, and its codes were built upon the requirements:</p> <p>1) To bring Python and R capabilities to deal with raster products. The radar products processing is feasible using Python resources, while raster sampling is faster using R resources.</p> <p>2) It uses the packages: asf_search (Python 3.9), for downloading satellite products, main radar satellites, from the Alaska Satellite Facility; snappy (Python 3.6), the Python implementation of the SeNtinel Application Platform, from the European Space Agency (SNAP-ESA), which contains the Sentinel-1 Toolbox; and the terra package (R version 4.2.1), for dealing with raster and vectors fastest than other resources.</p> <p>3) I tried not to personalize the pipeline, as you can personalize your way and needs. This means that you are free to change it on your way, e.g., changing Sentinel-1 algorithms, methods, AOI, etc.</p> <p>4) I advise you to peek rapidly at the below-presented flowcharts, as they mean to summarize what the codes exactly do.</p>"},{"location":"#how-does-it-work-and-what-does-it-do","title":"How does it work and what does it do?","text":""},{"location":"#script-01-geographical-search-and-batch-download-of-sar-data-in-the-alaska-satellite-facility-asf-dataset","title":"Script 01: geographical search and batch download of SAR data in the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) dataset:","text":"<p>This code uses asf_search resources to do a geographical search within the ASF SAR data catalog, learn more about how its features work in:</p> <p>1) asf_search Basics</p> <p>2) Bulk Download Sentinel 1 SAR Data</p> <p>3) (in Portuguese) Download simult\u00e2neo de v\u00e1rias imagens de SAR (como Sentinel-1) via Python</p> <p>WARNING: To download bulk products, use a Python 3.9 environment. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#script-02-reading-and-visualizing-a-single-product-band","title":"Script 02: reading and visualizing a single product band:","text":"<p>WARNING: From here and forward you will need a Python 3.4 or 3.6 environment, it is a SNAP project requirement.
