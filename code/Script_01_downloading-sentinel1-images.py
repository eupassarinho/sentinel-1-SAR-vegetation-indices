Code wroten to download Sentinel-1 scenes via geographical search using the
Alaska Satellite Facility module.
    Inputs: Excel sheet with point samples (geographic coordinates) and
    searching parameters;
    Output: Selected Sentinel-1 scenes.

WARNING 1:
    The first part of this script only deal with Excel files containing
    geographical points. Then a convex hull polygon is created based on
    filtered point coordinates.
    If you already has a polygon to do your geographical search, just step the
    first part.
WARNING 2:
    If you are using a Python 3.6 environment, it is probable that batch
    download won't work properly, because "download" is not a list property.

#%% REQUESTED MODULES

# For data handling (including dealing with Excel files)
import pandas as pd
# For dealing with directories
from os import listdir
# For data viz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# For searching images on Alaska Satellite Facility API 
import asf_search as asf
# For dealing with geospatial data (including geo data frames)
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import MultiPoint, shape

#%% USING PANDAS TO IMPORT THE DATASET CONTAINING SAMPLING POINTS:

file_path = r'J:/path_to/your-spatial_database'

# As my geographic coordinates are stored in a Excel file, I'm importing it
# as a pandas object:
myPandasDF = pd.read_excel(
    io = file_path + '\\' + "MyExcelSpatialDatabase.xlsx",
    sheet_name = "Sheet1", skiprows = 1
    )

# As the coordinates are labeled with the date (moth) which them were
# collected, and in this script I want search images based on the date
# of the points, the following command creates a new variable for storing the
# month of the sample. It do it throught pandas Series.dt properties of
# datetime structured data: 
myPandasDF['month'] = myPandasDF['DATA'].dt.month
#myPandasDF = myPandasDF[myPandasDF.month == 7]

# Doing the geographical search:

#%% VISUALIZING BOTH A SELECTED IMAGE FOOTPRINT AND THE SEARCH POLYGON

# Set a index for selecting a item in the results object:
